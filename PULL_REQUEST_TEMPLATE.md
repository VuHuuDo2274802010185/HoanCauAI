- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Desktop app connects to Python backend
- [ ] File upload and CV analysis work end-to-end
- [ ] Chat functionality works in all interfaces

### Documentation Review
- [ ] README files are accurate and helpful
- [ ] API documentation is complete
- [ ] Installation instructions are clear
- [ ] Examples and tutorials are working

### Performance & Security
- [ ] No performance degradation in existing features
- [ ] CORS configuration is appropriate
- [ ] File upload security is implemented
- [ ] API rate limiting considerations documented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Test API Server
```bash
# Start API server
./scripts/start-api.sh

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/models

# Check widget demo
open http://localhost:8000/widget
```

### 2. Test All Services
```bash
# Start everything
./scripts/run-all.sh

# Verify all services are running:
# - API: http://localhost:8000
# - Streamlit: http://localhost:8501
# - Desktop app window should open
```

### 3. Test Desktop App Build
```bash
# Build for current platform
./scripts/build-electron.sh

# Check output in desktop/dist/
ls -la desktop/dist/
```

### 4. Test Widget Embedding
- Open `widget/embed.html` in browser
- Try iframe integration method
- Test file upload and analysis
- Verify chat functionality works

## 🚨 Breaking Changes
**None** - All existing functionality is preserved. This is purely additive.
