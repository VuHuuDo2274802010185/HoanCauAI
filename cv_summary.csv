BRAIN CANCER CLASSIFICATION - TEAM PROJECT (3 MEMBERS)
Dec 2024 - Jan 2024
Dataset: Brain Tumor MRI dataset from Kaggle
Description: Built a CNN model based on the Xception architecture to classify brain MRI images into four types: glioma,
meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor.
Responsibilities:
Data Preprocessing & Augmentation: Processed 7,022 MRI images with resizing, denoising, and pixel normalization. Applied
augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, elastic deformation) using TensorFlow/Keras.
Model Design & Optimization: Implemented a CNN based on Xception architecture. Tuned hyperparameters (learning rate,
batch size) via GridSearchCV and EarlyStopping, improving accuracy from 92% to 98.9%.
Training & Evaluation: Trained on 5,712 augmented images over 30 epochs using Adam optimizer. Achieved 99.2% validation
accuracy; precision and recall exceeded 98% across all classes (evaluated with confusion matrix and classification report).
Outcome: Achieved 98% accuracy on the validation set.
