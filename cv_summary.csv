Applied augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, elastic deformation) using TensorFlow/Keras. Model Design & Optimization: Implemented a CNN based on Xception architecture. Tuned hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) via GridSearchCV and EarlyStopping, improving accuracy from 92% to 98.9%. Training & Evaluation: Trained on 5,712 augmented images over 30 epochs using Adam optimizer. Achieved 99.2% validation accuracy; precision and recall exceeded 98% across all classes (evaluated with confusion matrix and classification report). Outcome: Achieved 98% accuracy on the validation set.', 'link': 'https://github.com/Huysdfghf/brain-cancer-classification'}]"
